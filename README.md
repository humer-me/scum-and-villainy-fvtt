This work is based on Scum and Villainy (found at https://www.evilhat.com/home/scum-and-villainy/), product of Evil Hat Games, developed and authored by Stras Acimovic and John LeBoeuf-Little.

The conversion for this system would not have been possible without the work of [megastruktur](https://github.com/megastruktur) in adapting Blades in the Dark to Foundry VTT.

Scum and Villainy is itself a "Forged in the Dark" game based on Blades in the Dark (found at http://www.bladesinthedark.com/), product of One Seven Design, developed and authored by John Harper.
